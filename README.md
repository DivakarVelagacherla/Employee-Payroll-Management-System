this is a practice project on java and OOPS concepts for payroll management system

In this project you can create employees, delete employees, run payroll, list all employees
This is a simple practice project.

I haven't take any security measures or employees ids into consideration

I can improve this project by connecting it to database but i wanted to keep things simple and plain

This project is only focusing on understanding OOPS concepts.
